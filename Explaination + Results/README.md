## Results

The project is overall divided into five phases which are,
- *PID controller* 
- *Object Detection* 
- *Trafic Signal Handling* 
- *Obstacle Detection* 
- *PID + Traffic Signals + Obstacles* 

All the directories contain a diagram that expains the basic flow throughout that stage, followed by result snippets.
