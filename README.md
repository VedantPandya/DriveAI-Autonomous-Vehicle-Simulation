# DriveAI-Autonomous-Vehicle-Simulation
An end-to-end framework for autonomous vehicle maneuvering in the Carla Simulator. It navigates predefined trajectories using a PID controller, detects and reacts to traffic signals and obstacles, and classifies objects based on their proximity and impact on the vehicleâ€™s trajectory.
