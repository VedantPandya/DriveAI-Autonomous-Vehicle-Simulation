# Drive.AI

End-End framework for autonomous manoeuvring of vehicles in Carla Simulator 
from point A to point B on a predefined trajectory following traffic signals 
and interacting appropriately with environment agents. 
### The task of maneuvering is divided into sub problems: 


- *PID controller* : Navigate the vehicle from point A to point B
- *Object Detection* : Detect Traffic signals and Vehicles
- *Traffic Signal Handling* : Overriding PID control as per Traffic Signals
- *Obstacle Detection* : Classify the detected objects are close with immediate impact, near with delayed impact and far with no impact on the trajectory
- *PID + Traffic Signals + Obstacles* : Combining all the models created.
